## 🚀 What is ReflexEngine?  

ReflexEngine is a modern Lua runtime built from the ground up with **performance** and **efficiency** in mind.  
Whether you're working on **embedded systems, game development, or real-time applications**, Reflex aims to be a fast, minimal, and portable solution.  

Right now, it's still **very early in development**, but the goal is to create a **standalone, zero-dependency** Lua runtime that’s lightweight and **crazy fast**.  

---

## 🔥 Why ReflexEngine?  

✅ **Blazing-Fast Execution** – JIT compilation (planned) for near-native speeds  
✅ **Tiny Memory Footprint** – Optimized to run on systems with as little as **256KB RAM**  
✅ **Standalone** – No external dependencies, just ReflexEngine itself  
✅ **Full Lua 5.4 Support** – Everything you love about Lua, but faster  
✅ **Cross-Platform** – Targeting **Linux, macOS, Windows**, and **embedded devices**

## 📌 Development Roadmap  

We’re actively working on getting Reflex up and running. Here’s what’s done and what’s next:  

- [x] **Initial architecture design**  
- [x] **Standard library setup**  
- [ ] **Core runtime implementation** 🚧 *(In progress)*  
- [ ] **JIT compiler development**  
- [ ] **Cross-platform build system**  
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**  
- [ ] **Documentation**  
- [ ] **First alpha release** 🚀

## 📖 Documentation  

Right now, the project is still in **early development**, but once we have more to show,  
you’ll find detailed documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/reflexengine/reflex/wiki).

## ⚡ What Can You Build?  

### 🌍 Lightweight Web Server (Planned)  

```lua
local http = reflex.http.createServer()

http.listen(8080, function ()
    reflex.logger.info("ReflexEngine server started!")
end)
```

> 🚧 *Not implemented yet! Just a preview of what’s planned.*
